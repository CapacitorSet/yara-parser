This is a fork of Northern-Lights/yara-parser for custom usage. It was stripped of the `y2j` tool and documentation. The original readme follows.

# yara-parser

`yara-parser` is a Go library for manipulating YARA rulesets.  Its key feature is that it uses the same grammar and lexer files as the original libyara to ensure that lexing and parsing work exactly like YARA.  The grammar and lexer files have been modified to fill Go data structures for ruleset manipulation instead of compiling rulesets for data matching.

Using `yara-parser`, one will be able to read YARA rulesets to programatically change metadata, rule names, rule modifiers, tags, strings, and more.

## Installation

For the following `go get` commands, if you experience any issues, they are likely due to outdated versions of Go.  The project uses features introduced in Go 1.10.  Installation should proceed normally after an update.

### Grammar Library

Use the following command to install the grammar library for deserializing YARA rulesets.

`go get -u github.com/honeytrap/yara-parser/grammar`

## Go Usage

Sample usage for working with rulesets in Go looks like the following:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/honeytrap/yara-parser/grammar"
)

func main() {
	input, err := os.Open(os.Args[1])   // Single argument: path to your file
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error: %s\n", err)
	}

	ruleset, err := grammar.Parse(input, os.Stdout)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(`Parsing failed: "%s"`, err)
	}

    fmt.Printf("Ruleset:\n%v\n", ruleset)
    
    // Manipulate the first rule
    rule := ruleset.Rules[0]
    rule.Identifier = "new_rule_name"
    rule.Modifiers.Global = true
    rule.Modifiers.Private = false
}
```

## Development

Currently, there is a `Makefile` which will build the parser, lexer, and main application.  For this to work, the following are needed:

| Command | Source (`go get`) |
| - | - |
| `goyacc` | `golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc` |
| `flexgo` | `github.com/pebbe/flexgo` (Tool must be built manually)|

## Limitations

Currently, there are no guarantees with the library that modified rules will serialize back into a valid YARA ruleset.  For example, you can set `rule.Identifier = "123"`, but this would be invalid YARA.  Additionally, adding or removing strings may cause a condition to become invalid, and conditions are currently treated only as text.
